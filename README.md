# OpenCL-ADMM-Optimization
Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization via ADAM algorithm 

Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is an optimization problem solver with good robustness of method of multipliers that supports decomposition. In addition, ADMM gives simple single-processor algorithms that can be competitive with state-of-the-art that can be used to coordinate many processors, each solving a substantial problem, to solve a very large problem.

Implementation of ADMM for an energy function for the purpose of super resolution reconstruction of an image.
